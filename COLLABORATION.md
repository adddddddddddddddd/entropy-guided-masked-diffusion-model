# Research Collaboration Opportunities

## Current Research Questions

### 1. Theoretical Analysis
- What is the optimal T schedule for different task types?
- How does T affect the effective capacity of the model?
- Can we prove convergence guarantees under temperature modulation?

### 2. Empirical Studies
- Large-scale pretraining with T (100B+ tokens)
- Cross-architectural validation (BERT, GPT, T5)
- Multi-task learning with adaptive T

### 3. Novel Applications
- Temperature-guided controllable generation
- Curriculum learning via T scheduling
- Few-shot learning with temperature adaptation

## What I am Looking For

### Internship
I am looking for an internship starting March 2026 outside of France.
### What I want to do
- Familiarize with SOTA models of differents fields to understand it better. Mechanistic Interpretability and Alignements are path I would be keen to follow. I love Fundammental Physics and hopefully we will find more links inside of these algorithm
